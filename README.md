# Sentiment140 Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Notebook for classifying sentiments (positive or negative) in tweets using a variation of the Sentiment140 dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, tokenization, padding, and model training using a Bidirectional LSTM with pre-trained GloVe embeddings.

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify the sentiment of tweets as either positive or negative. It involves preprocessing the Sentiment140 dataset, tokenizing the text, padding sequences, and training a Bidirectional LSTM model using pre-trained GloVe embeddings.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a variation of the [Sentiment140 dataset](http://help.sentiment140.com/home), which contains 1.6 million tweets labeled with their sentiment (0 for negative and 4 for positive).

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using training and validation accuracy and loss, with visualizations provided for both metrics over 20 epochs.
